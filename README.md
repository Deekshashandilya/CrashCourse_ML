This repository consists of all types of Machine Learning Models

**Machine learning** is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and models that allow computer systems to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves the development of computational models and techniques that enable computers to automatically analyze and interpret complex patterns in data, and then use this knowledge to make informed decisions or predictions.

In traditional programming, a human programmer writes explicit instructions for a computer to follow. However, in machine learning, the computer learns from examples or data provided to it. Instead of explicitly programming all the rules, machine learning algorithms are designed to automatically learn patterns and relationships in the data through statistical analysis, iterative processes, and optimization techniques.

Machine learning algorithms can be broadly categorized into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning:

**1. Supervised Learning**: In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on labeled examples, where each example consists of an input (or features) and a corresponding output (or label). The algorithm learns to map the input data to the correct output by generalizing from the training examples. This enables the algorithm to make predictions or classify new, unseen data based on the patterns it has learned.

**2. Unsupervised Learning**: Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, where the algorithm learns to identify patterns or structures in the data without any predefined labels. It aims to discover hidden patterns or relationships in the data, such as clustering similar data points or dimensionality reduction.

**3. Reinforcement Learning**: Reinforcement learning involves training an algorithm to make sequential decisions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward. The algorithm learns through trial and error by interacting with the environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. It learns to take actions that lead to the highest cumulative reward over time.
